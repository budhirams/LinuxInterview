Hi Everyone,

Today is my last working day at Idemia, and I just want to say a big thank you to all of you.

I'm really thankful to the company for giving me the chance to work and learn here. It has been a great experience that I will always remember.

A special thanks to my manager for your support and guidance. I’ve learned a lot from you, and I truly appreciate your help during my time here.

To all my friends and teammates, thank you for being so kind and supportive. I’ve enjoyed working with you, and I will miss our chats, teamwork, and good times together.

If I have made any mistakes or unknowingly hurt anyone during my time here, please forgive me like a younger brother.

And yes, if you ever need any technical help, feel free to call me anytime — I’ll definitely try my best to help you.

Finally, I would like to wish you all the very best in your work and future. I also hope Idemia continues to grow and achieve great success ahead.

Thankyou.
