Select loop and its uses:
-----------------------------------------------------
select option in docker nginx ansible
do
  echo ${option}
done


bis@LAPTOP-MAV6U7B1:~/while loop$ ./whil2.sh 
1) docker
2) nginx
3) ansible
#? 1
docker
#? 2
nginx
#? 1
docker
#?                  it is waiting for option (#?)



in place of waiting for option you can give any message
PS3="select your service to know the status:"



🧠 What is PS3?
PS3 is a special built-in prompt variable in Bash, used only with the select command.

It sets the message that is shown when prompting the user for input.

📌 Default:
#?


✅ Custom:
PS3="Choose an option: "


🧾 Why is PS3 Needed?
The select loop in Bash is used to create a simple menu from an array of choices.

Example:


❓ Can I Replace PS3 with Something Else?
❌ No — You cannot use another variable name to customize the select prompt.
Only PS3 is recognized by Bash for this specific purpose.



🧠 Summary

Variable	Purpose	                  Default	Customizable?
PS1	        Main shell prompt ($)	   $	        ✅ Yes
PS2	        Continuation prompt (>)    >	        ✅ Yes
PS3	        select prompt          	  #?	        ✅ Yes (only for select)
PS4      	Debug prompt (+)	   +	        ✅ Yes






------------------------------------------ some exercise ------------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash
PS3="select your service to know the status:"
select option in docker nginx ansible
do
  echo ${option}
done

bis@LAPTOP-MAV6U7B1:~/while loop$ ./whil2.sh 
1) docker
2) nginx
3) ansible
select your service to know the status:1        ----------- now you can get different message , inplace of default message #?
docker
select your service to know the status:




most case we used this for case statement logic
--------------------------------------------------


#!/bin/bash
PS3="select your service to know the status:"
select option in docker nginx sshd
do
  case ${option} in 
      docker) systemctl status docker
              ;;
      nginx)  systemctl status nginx --no-pager

              ;;
      sshd) systemctl status sshd.service
              ;;
      *) echo "If you are selection another value it will show you option is invalid"
            ;;
   esac  





select your service to know the status:6
If you are selection another value it will show you option is invalid
select your service to know the status:

 


NOTE: you have to write a logic to stop it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In option we have to chose stop optin

#!/bin/bash
PS3="select your service to know the status:"
select option in docker nginx sshd stop
do
  case ${option} in 
      docker) systemctl status docker
              ;;
      nginx)  systemctl status nginx --no-pager

              ;;
      sshd) systemctl status sshd.service
              ;;
      stop)  break
              ;;
      *) echo "If you are selection another value it will show you option is invalid"
            ;;
   esac   

done




select your service to know the status:4
