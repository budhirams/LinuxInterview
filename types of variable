------------------------ RULES TO DEFINE VARIABLES -------------------------
#!/usr/bin/bash
myname=budhiram
myName=budhiram
my_name=budhiram
myName1=budhiram

Note: there should not be any space while defining a variable
means below is wrong 
a1= 6
a3 =8
correct is 

a1=6
a3=8

NOTE: use quote for the data if data consist of spaces
myNameValue="shell scripting"


NOTE: you can store the output of a command into a variable
  anyVariable=$(command)
  anyVariable=`command`

NOTE: you can assign one variable value/data into another using:
  Name="shell scripting"
  NewName=${Name}

NOTE: Better to avoid CAPITAL Letters for variables as system variables are in CAPITALS , if you want to use check once before creating it.
   suppose you are defining variable in CAPITAL letter
   MYNAME=
   USER
   Firstly check 
   # echo ${MYNAME}
    no output means you can define

   # echo ${USER
     root
   means getting some output so you can not define in CAPITAL letter variable  USER
