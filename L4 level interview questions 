Linux L4 Real-time interview questions and answers. Part-1

1. A server becomes unresponsive — what’s your step-by-step approach to troubleshoot?
Check basic connectivity:
ping <server_ip>
ssh <server_ip>

If ping works but SSH fails:

Check CPU/memory:
top | head -20
Or, if SSH unresponsive → access via console or IPMI.

Check I/O wait and load:
iostat -xm 5
vmstat 5
uptime

Check for disk full (common cause):
df -h
du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head

Check kernel messages:
dmesg | tail -50

If system is hung (high load, low I/O):

Find blocking process:
ps -eo pid,stat,cmd | grep 'D'
“D” = Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O wait).

2. How do you identify a process causing high load but not high CPU usage?

That usually indicates I/O wait or blocked processes.

Check:
vmstat 1 5

Look for high wa (I/O wait) value.
iotop -ao

Shows which process is performing heavy I/O.
If it’s a disk issue:
sar -d 1 5
or
iostat -x 1 5

3. How do you debug high memory usage or memory leaks in Linux?

Check memory summary:
free -m

Find top memory consumers:
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head

If memory is full but swap is active → possible leak.

For deeper kernel memory leak analysis:
slabtop
cat /proc/meminfo

Use smem or pmap <pid> to check per-process memory footprint.

4. How do you handle a situation where /var or /tmp is 100% full?
Identify large files:
du -sh /var/* | sort -rh | head
Common culprits: logs, cores, temp files.
journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
rm -rf /tmp/*
Check for deleted but still-open files:
lsof | grep deleted
Truncate large logs safely:
: > /var/log/filename.log

Prevent recurrence — add logrotate or move /var to a separate partition.

5. What is the difference between a zombie and an orphan process?

Type	Description	Resolution
Zombie	Process completed execution but still has an entry in the process table (parent hasn’t read exit status).	Kill or restart parent process.
Orphan	Parent process terminated, leaving the child running (gets re-parented to init or systemd).	Usually harmless, systemd adopts it.
Check for zombies:
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,cmd | grep Z

6. How do you trace which process deleted or modified a file?
auditctl -w /path/to/file -p war -k filewatch
ausearch -k filewatch
Or with inotify:
inotifywait -m /path/to/dir

For real-time event auditing, L4s often integrate with SELinux/Auditd rules.

7. How do you analyze system performance using sar or sysstat?
sar helps analyze historic CPU, memory, and I/O metrics.

sar -u 5 5     # CPU usage
sar -r 5 5     # Memory usage
sar -d 5 5     # Disk I/O
sar -n DEV 5 5   # Network

8. Explain how you’d troubleshoot a slow NFS mount.
Check network latency:
ping nfs-server
traceroute nfs-server
Check NFS mount options:
mount | grep nfs
Ensure using noatime, hard, tcp, rsize/wsize=65536.

Test read/write:

dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test bs=1M count=100 oflag=direct

Check NFS stats:

nfsstat -s -c
If slow, analyze server-side logs: /var/log/messages
