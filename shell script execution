shell is going to execute line by line

for example
[root@worker ~]# cat new.sh
#!/usr/bin/bash

y=$((m*x+c))
m=2
x=3
c=4
echo $y
[root@worker ~]# #suppose I have change the value in previous one
[root@worker ~]# vim new.sh
[root@worker ~]# ./new.sh
10
[root@worker ~]# cat new.sh
#!/usr/bin/bash
m=2
x=3
c=4

y=$((m*x+c))
echo $y


so from above example it is working line by line
